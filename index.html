            <p>I moved to Nashville so I could pursue a return to a career in web development and provide a better home
              life for my family.</p>
            <p>Having worked as a graphic artist and web designer out of college, life took some twists and turns, and I
              found myself working as a stenographer in New York City, transcribing deposition and court testimony at
              over 225 words per minute.</p>
            <p>While I enjoyed the experience working alongside some of the best attorneys in the country, I missed the
              creativity, logic, and problem solving from my early days in web development.</p>
            <p>My time at NSS has confirmed that web development is where I belong. I love the challenge involved in
              solving real-world problems, learning new technology, and crave that rush I get when my code works as
              intended.</p>
            <p>Working as part of a team with a common goal, the camaraderie with my fellow developers, and serving up
              an endless supply of high-fives has been an added bonus!</p>

        <div class="flex">
          <section class="project_description">
            <p>As an avid basketball player, I wanted an app enabling me to log my shots so I could track my accuracy at
              different spots on the court to help focus on areas that needed improvement. Additionally, as a youth
              basketball coach, I felt a mobile app would be perfect for young players to track their progress as well.
              And by adding a leaderboard and leveling up features, I surmised the competitive element would also
              encourage players to take more shots with the goal of improving their accuracy.</p>
            <p><strong>SwishList</strong> is a responsive basketball shot-tracking app that accomplishes all of that and
              more. Players can log their workouts and shots using a dynamically-generated basketball court map built
              using custom CSS. Individual statistics are calculated and presented along with leaderboards in addition
              to the user's profile and motivational quotes for added inspiration.</p>
            <p><strong>SwishList</strong> was written in React using JSON Server with a REST API.</p>
